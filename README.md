## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Java 21+
- Maven
- (Optional) Docker

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
  The load balancer is configured via environment variables.

## ‚úÖ Required Environment Variable

### ‚úÖ Only LB_BACKENDS is required ‚Äî all others are optional and have default values.

| Variable	  | Description	                                            | Example |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |--------|
| LB_BACKENDS |	Comma-separated list of backend servers in host:port format	| 192.168.15.72:9001,203.0.113.57:9002 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Environment Variables
| Variable                     | Description                                                                     | Default      | Example           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |-------------------|
| LB_PORT	                   | Port the load balancer listens on	                                             | 8080         | 9000              |
| LB_STRATEGY          	       | Backend selection strategy: ROUND_ROBIN, LEAST_CONNECTIONS, or FIRST_AVAILABLE	 | ROUND_ROBIN	| LEAST_CONNECTIONS |
| LB_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS  | Interval (in milliseconds) between health checks	                             | 5000	        | 2000              | 
| LB_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS   | Timeout (in milliseconds) for each health check socket connection	             | 1000	        | 1500              |

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example: Minimal Run
export LB_BACKENDS=localhost:9001,localhost:9002
java -jar target/PayrocLoadBalancerTechnicalChallenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example: Full Configuration with docker
docker build -t load-balancer .
docker run -e LB_BACKENDS=localhost:9001 -e LB_PORT=1234 -e LB_STRATEGY=FIRST_AVAILABLE -e LB_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS=10000 -e LB_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS=3000 -p 8080:1234 load-balancer
- Note: The LB_PORT is the mapping to the docker containers internal port (so not really needed unless in some very special case)
- Note: Also using localhost backends won't work as they would need to be in the docker container, you'd need to have the connections being made from the docker to an external service
üí° If LB_BACKENDS is not set, the load balancer will fail to start.

### Intellij

For the purposes of just having a look at how this works for yourselves quickly. I personally used ncat to host some backends locally and then ran the Main class in intellij using environment variables to configure the load balancer. Then I used putty instances to send raw data to the load balancer and manually checked which ncat instance picked up the input. This isn't realistic as the nature of TCP connections and layer 4 load balancers are that the connect won't remain open for so long
